The [Qbs build tool](http://qbs.io) version 2.3.0 is available.

## What's new

As [[release-2.2.1|hinted]] at last time, the main
feature in this release is the use of the new Language Protocol Server for "go to definition" in
certain contexts and auto-completion.

<!-- more -->

### Language Protocol Server

We have added a Language Protocol Server to Qbs which provides IDE-agnostic tooling
(<https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol>). On top of it, we added the "go to
definition" feature to QtCreator - it is now possible to open source files from *.qbs files by
simply pressing F2. We have also added support for autocompletion of the module properties:

![[release-2.3.0.image.1.png|autocompletion]]

### General
We have added a possibility to export products to CMake via the new Exporter.cmake module. This
allows to use libraries built with Qbs directly with CMake projects without the need to use an
intermediate representation in form of the Exporter.pkgconfig.

We deprecated the "fallback" module
[provider](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/module-providers.html#how-qbs-uses-module-providers) in favor of
the [qbspkgconfig](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html) provider.
In Qbs, module providers generate missing modules during the project configuration ("resolve")
stage. Historically, we had only Qt and "fallback" module providers and there was no way to control
which providers are run until we introduced "named" module providers in
[[release-1.21|Qbs 1.21]]. At the same time, we've added the
`qbspkgconfig` provider that reads .pc files directly, avoiding expensive invocations of the
`pkg-config` tool. Since then, we had two almost identical providers that work on top of .pc files.
However, the problem with the "fallback" provider is that it works differently from other
providers as well as suffers performance issues and has the same bugs as the `pkg-config` tool.
Thus, we decided to deprecate the "fallback" provider in Qbs 2.3.0 and remove it in Qbs 2.4.0.
For details on how to use the `qbspkgconfig` provider, see the
[provider page](https://qbs.io//docs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig/) in the documentation.
Also, please report any bugs in the `qbspkgconfig` to the
[bug tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS/).

We have added a new [Tutorial](https://qbs.io//docs/tutorial/) section in the documentaion to make
it easier to grasp core concepts and make users familiar with best practices. Also, we added a
new [example](https://github.com/qbs/qbs/blob/master/examples/exporters/qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs)
on how to use Exporter modules.

If a project needs to be re-resolved, we now print the reason. Also, we rewrote the wildards
handling to track changes more accurately.

### C/C++ Support
We fixed an issue with complex project structure that lead to a non-linear algorithm during
traversing of the dependencies. Now, private dependencies (dependencies of static libraries) of
products are not traversed more than once anymore
([QBS-1714](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1714)).

### Language
* Module properties are now accessible for groups in modules
  ([QBS-1770](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1770)).
* The qbspkgconfig.mergeDependencies property was removed. This feature only existed because of
  performance limitations which were fixed in [[release-2.1.0|Qbs 2.1.0]].
* ModuleProviders now support the
  [allowedValues](https://qbs.io//docs/qml-qbslanguageitems-propertyoptions/#allowedValues-prop)
  property of the PropertyOptions item ([QBS-1748](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1748)).
