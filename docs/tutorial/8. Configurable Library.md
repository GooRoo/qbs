# Configurable Library

In this chapter, we will make our library more configurable. We will add configuration options
to be able to choose between static and dynamic builds.

We start with some new properties in the `mybuildconfig` module:

```qml title="qbs/modules/mybuildconfig/mybuildconfig.qbs"
Module {
    ...
    property bool staticBuild: false
    property bool installStaticLib: true
    ...
}
```

We need to do some modifications to export macros in the `lib/lib_global.h` header:

```c title="lib/lib_global.h" hl_lines="1-3"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-8/lib/lib_global.h:snippet0"
```

Here' we added a new branch when `MYLIB_STATIC_LIBRARY` is defined. In that case, we make
the `MY_LIB_EXPORT` macro empty.

Now, let's modify the `qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs` file as follows:

```qml title="qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs" hl_lines="1 4 9-12 18-19"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-8/qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs:snippet0"
```

First thing to notice is that we changed the type of the item from [[DynamicLibrary]] to the
[[Library]] item which is a common base item for dynamic and static libraries.

Second, we change the [[Product::type|type]] of the product so it depends on the `staticBuild`
property:

```qml
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-8/qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs:snippet1"
```

Third, we change our _export macro_ to be different in the static and dynamic builds to
correspond with the changes we made to the `lib_global.h`:

```qml
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-8/qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs:snippet2"
```

Note that in a static build we export the `MYLIB_STATIC_LIBRARY` macro so that the dependent
products will know whether they link to a static or dynamic library:

```qml
Export {
    ...
    --8<-- "tutorial/chapter-8/qbs/imports/MyLibrary.qbs:snippet3"
}
```

Now we can build our project in dynamic or static mode:

```sh
$ qbs resolve modules.mybuildconfig.staticBuild:false && qbs build
...
$ ls default/install-root/usr/local/lib/
    libmylib.1.0.0.so
    libmylib.1.0.so
    libmylib.1.so
    libmylib.so
$ rm -r default
$ qbs resolve modules.mybuildconfig.staticBuild:true && qbs build
...
$ $ ls default/install-root/usr/local/lib/
    libmylib.a
```
