# C++20 Modules

This tutorial implies you have some knowledge about C++20 modules. If not, see
[Overview of modules in C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp) for
introduction.

## Named Modules

Using C++20 modules with Qbs is pretty straightforward.
Let's suppose you have a module file that exports a single function `printHello`:

```cpp title="hello.cppm"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-10-1/hello.cppm:snippet0"
```

!!! note
    Currently, Clang only recognizes `.cppm` files as modules, however, for GCC and MSVC
    Qbs also recognizes `.ixx` files as C++ modules. Qbs assigns the `"cppm"` file tag to these
    files. You can assign this tag manually to module files with different extensions.

This function is later used in the `main.cpp` file as follows:

```cpp title="main.cpp"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-10-1/main.cpp:snippet0"
```

The project file simply lists files and sets the
[[cpp::forceUseCxxModules|cpp.forceUseCxxModules]] property to `true`.

```qml title="myproject.qbs"
CppApplication {
    consoleApplication: true
    install: true
    files: ["hello.cppm", "main.cpp"]
    cpp.cxxLanguageVersion: "c++20"
    cpp.forceUseCxxModules: true
}
```

Now, you can build the project by simply calling `qbs`, assuming that your compiler supports
C++20 modules.

## Module Partitions

[Module partitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp?view=msvc-170#module-partitions)
are treated as regular modules and should also have the same extension or assigned the
`"cppm"` tag manually. See this
[example](https://github.com/qbs/qbs/tree/2.5/examples/cxx-modules/mod3) on how to
use both interface module and partitions.

## Modules and Libraries

Using modules in dynamic libraries requires using the same export/import macros as it was shown
in the [[3. Dynamic Library|Dynamic Library]] section:

```cpp title="lib/hello.cppm"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-10-2/lib/hello.cppm:snippet0"
```

As shown in that section, the library `.qbs` file should also define the `MYLIB_LIBRARY` macro
in order to mark symbols as exported:

```qml title="lib/lib.qbs"
DynamicLibrary {
    name: "mylib"
    files: ["hello.cppm", "lib_global.h"]
    version: "1.0.0"
    install: true

    Depends { name: "cpp" }
    cpp.defines: "MYLIB_LIBRARY"
    cpp.cxxLanguageVersion: "c++20"
    cpp.forceUseCxxModules: true
    // ...
}
```

[example](https://github.com/qbs/qbs/tree/master/tutorial/chapter-10-2).
