# Autotest

Now that we can re-use our base items, let's add a simple autotest. We inherit the new item
from the `MyApplication` item and add an `"autotest"` type:

```qml title="qbs/imports/MyAutoTest.qbs"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-5/qbs/imports/MyAutoTest.qbs:snippet0"
```
This additional type is required for the helper [[AutotestRunner]] item. This item runs all
products with the `"autotest"` type when it is being built. It also implicitly depends on all
such products, so they will be built before running as well.

Let's add this item to our top-level [[Project]] item:

```qml hl_lines="5-7"
Project {
    name: "My Project"
    minimumQbsVersion: "2.0"
    // ...
    AutotestRunner {
        timeout: 60
    }
}
```
Here we set the [[AutotestRunner::timeout|timeout]] property to 60 seconds so that our runner
kills tests that run way too long.

Now we need to add our first test. Let's create a new product with the following content:

```qml title="test/test.qbs"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-5/test/test.qbs:snippet0"
```
Here we depend on our library (which we are going to test), set the product
[[Product::name|name]], and specify the source file, which looks like this:
```c title="test/test.c"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-5/test/test.c:snippet0"
```
The test compares the value from the library with the value from the command line.

Don't forget to add the new test product to the references property in the Project:
```qml title="myproject.qbs"
--8<-- "tutorial/chapter-5/myproject.qbs:snippet0"
```
Now we can build the autotest product â€“ this will also launch our test:
```qml
$ qbs build -p "autotest-runner"
...
running test mytest [autotest-runner]
Build done for configuration default.
```
